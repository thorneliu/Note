So in practical terms, what you get with Redis Cluster?
The ability to automatically split your dataset among multiple nodes.
The ability to continue operations when a subset of the nodes are experiencing failures or are unable to communicate with the rest of the cluster.


类似蚂蚁的集群 整体迁徙的时候
每个蚂蚁的功能比较简单 但是群体的容错性很强
丢掉一小部分都问题不大
